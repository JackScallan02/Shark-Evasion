# Shark-Evasion
Web game made with Javascript and JQuery located at http://jackscallan.com/game.html

### How to play
Control the fish with your mouse and evade the sharks. You can catch some air time but if you do for too long, you lose. It's simple!

### Additional features
In the recent version of the game, a "fish shop" was added. Now, you can choose from a variety of fish that have different characteristics.

### How it works
Shark Evasion uses an event listener for mouse movement, and maps the fish to the coordinates of your mouse. Using intervals and timeouts, the sharks swim by at random time intervals. Phases 3 and 4, determined by a timeout, increase the quantity of sharks coming in at a given time.

### Demo
Note: gif is choppy but game is not.
